Upgrading sventon from version 1.0 or earlier

The sventon configuration settings was stored in the file
svn/WEB-INF/classes/sventon.properties in older versions.

From version 1.1, the configuration files are stored in a 
sub folder below the Servlet container's temporary directory.

Upgrade sventon by replacing the old svn.war file and walk
through the configuration screen again. The format of the
file sventon.properties has changed and cannot be copied
directly from an older sventon installation.

The disk persistent cache file format has changed since the
last version. A complete repository recache is necessary.
