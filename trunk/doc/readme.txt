sventon is a Subversion web client for Java Servlet containers. It makes use 
of mainly two different sofware packages, TMate JavaSVN and Spring framework, 
all necessary libraries are included in the project.

Java 1.5 is required for build and deploy, thus Tomcat 5.5 may be a good 
container companion. Jakarta Ant build files are supplied for building.

Build instructions:
1: Create file 'sventon.properties' in dir dev/java/conf and override properties from 'default-sventon.properties' and 
'log4j.properties' in same path as needed.

2: Run ant/build.xml for info on building.
