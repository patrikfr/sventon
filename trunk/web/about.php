<p>
Welcome to the sventon project!
</p>

<p>
sventon is a Java web application written for browsing <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> repositories.
</p>

<p>
sventon is really easy to install, all you need is a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">J2SE 5.0 runtime</a> and a Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 compliant webserver, such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat 5.5</a>. It features most basic functionality you'd expect from a tool like this, and a few more, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Easy installation
	<li>Browse, download, view logs and diff your repository files, and their properties
	<li>Easily keep track of changes using the 'latest commit' feature
	<li>Lightning fast search for instantly files, including camelCaseSearch
	<li>Flattening of directory structures for instantly finding the directory you're looking for
	<li>Browse inside archive files
	<li>View thumbnails of image files stored in the repository
    <li>... and more!
  </ul>
  Have a look at the <a href="index.php?page=features">feature page</a> for the current feature set.
