<p>
Welcome to the Sventon project!
</p>

<p>
The main goal of the Sventon project is to create a Java web application written for browsing <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> repositories.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the features we felt we were missing from existing Subversion web applications and that we hope to see in Sventon includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Insanely easy to install (we're almost there: drop the war file in the application server, enter a few configuration entries on a webpage, restart the application, and your done!).
    <li>Java, and just Java. If you have Java 5 and a web container, you're all set.
    <li>Neat features such as file search, directory flattening, possiblity to browse archive files such as JAR and ZIP files, thumbnail views of image files, RSS feeds, nice graphs over repository statistics, and more. And the usual stuff, such as logs view, diff and more.
  </ul>
  For the current feature set, have a look at <a href="index.php?page=features">Features</a>.
