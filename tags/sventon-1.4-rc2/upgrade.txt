UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS SVENTON VERSION

1. Stop the servlet container.
2. Locate the container's temp directory and the sub directory 'sventon'.
3. Delete the sub directory 'sventon/cache'.
3. Replace the svn.war file in the container's webapps install folder.
4. Start the servlet container.

If the repository cache has been enabled during setup, the background
cache/indexing process of the revisions and the files in HEAD will start.
If you have a repository with many files (and/or tags or branches),
this can take quite some time. You will be able to use sventon during the
indexing process, but the search and flatten buttons will be disabled until
indexing is completed.
